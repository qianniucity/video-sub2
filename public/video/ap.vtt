00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.901
Apple reportedly in talks with

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.321
a long-time rival to team up

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:05.040
on new AI offerings.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.941
That's as Apple

00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:07.581
also works to fend off a new

00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:08.361
charge under the

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:11.120
European Union's Digital Markets Act.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.381
Julia Borsten joins us with more in

00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:16.120
today's tech check. Hi Julia. Hi Tyler.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.961
Well as Apple pursues its new AI

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:19.901
strategy of partnerships, it's

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:21.681
in talks with Meta about potentially

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:23.441
integrating Meta's Lama AI

00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:25.000
models into Apple Intelligence.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.041
This according to a

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.280
Wall Street Journal report.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.601
Now this would be a notable

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:29.441
pivot from a

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:31.281
contentious relationship with

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.761
Metta as the two companies

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.101
clashed over privacy

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.961
and ad targeting and it comes

00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:37.181
after Apple partnered with

00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:38.621
OpenAI to bring its

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.620
chat GPT to phones.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.721
The company also said they'd

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:43.521
include Google's Gemini and

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.761
Apple is also reportedly in

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:48.240
talks with Anthropic and Perplexity.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.681
Now while

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.101
no money would change hands

00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.301
for these deals, Apple would serve as a

00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:53.561
gatekeeper and would take a

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:54.881
cut of subscription revenue

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:55.941
from premium

00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:57.441
services that AI companies

00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:59.201
could sell, just like Apple

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:01.620
takes a cut of App Store revenue.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.421
Now, speaking of Apple's App

00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:05.341
Store, regulators are now

00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:07.281
charging Apple with failing to comply

00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:09.280
with its Digital Markets Act,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.601
which focuses on large

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:13.160
platforms that are gatekeepers.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.621
The EU's case, which is the

00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:16.181
EU's first enforcement of the

00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:18.761
DMA, accuses Apple of not allowing

00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:20.661
developers to steer consumers

00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:22.841
to cheaper alternatives outside

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:23.821
of the App Store.

00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:25.701
And, unlike past regulatory

00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:27.081
threats, which did not pose

00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:29.481
much financial risk, the EU could

00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:31.041
fine Apple as much as 10

00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:34.000
percent of its worldwide revenue.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.221
This strict regulatory

00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:36.561
oversight in Europe is

00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:38.140
impacting Apple's strategy.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.681
Just last week, Apple said it

00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:40.921
would not roll out new

00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:42.301
generative AI features in

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.921
the region because of

00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:45.000
regulatory concerns.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.420
Kelly?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.540
Julia, we appreciate it.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.040
Thank you, Julia Borson.
